In 2004, we began working as an extended professional services team of a leading e-mail marketing company and started our journey with digital marketing services. Three years later, we began working with a sizeable ed-tech customer and focused on retail and e-commerce, simultaneously building our Salesforce Practice by becoming one of the first partners for Salesforce in India.</p>

        <h2>Culture and Values</h2>
        <h3>People First </h3>
        <p>Our people are an intrinsic part of our business, and we continuously cultivate a spirit of belonging, caring, and collaboration among them. Deep affection for each other, mutual respect, and synergy are core to our collective identity: without every person's contribution, we wouldn't be where we are today.</p>
          
        <h3>Integrity and Ethics</h3>
        <p>Fairmindedness, trust, scrupulousness, openness, and transparency are second nature to us. Whether it is paying our people or our partners on time or quoting fair prices to our clients, we ensure that we are ethical in our engagements with employees, vendors, clients, and public institutions.</p>
